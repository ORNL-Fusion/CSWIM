# Center for Simulation of RF Wave Interactions with Magnetohydrodynamics (CSWIM)

This is a "tombstone" site for an old project.  The intent is to present some basic information about the project, people, results, and follow-on activities.

The docs directory is the root of the web site.

The images and documents directories at this level are things we might want to add to the site at some point that seemed convenient to capture from the project site before it disappears.
